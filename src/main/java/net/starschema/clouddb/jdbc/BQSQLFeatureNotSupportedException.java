/**
 * <p>
 * An exception that provides information on a database access error or other
 * errors.<br>
 * With logging them to the external logfile.
 * <p>
 * Each SQLException provides several kinds of information:
 * <li>a string describing the error. This is used as the Java Exception
 * message, available via the method getMesasge.
 * <li>a "SQLstate" string, which follows either the XOPEN SQLstate conventions
 * or the SQL:2003 conventions. The values of the SQLState string are described
 * in the appropriate spec. The DatabaseMetaData method getSQLStateType can be
 * used to discover whether the driver returns the XOPEN type or the SQL:2003
 * type.
 * <li>an integer error code that is specific to each vendor. Normally this will
 * be the actual error code returned by the underlying database.
 * <li>a chain to a next Exception. This can be used to provide additional error
 * information.
 * <li>the causal relationship, if any for this SQLException.
